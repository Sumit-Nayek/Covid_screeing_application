###COVID-19 Screening System 🌡️

A web-based application to detect COVID-19 using demographic data, symptoms, and RT-PCR parameters, powered by Streamlit and machine learning models. Developed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early screening and risk assessment.
📖 Overview
This project is a user-friendly COVID-19 Screening System designed to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection based on:

Demographic Data: Age, gender, and premedical conditions.
Symptoms: Fever, cough, breathlessness, and more (19 symptoms total).
RT-PCR Parameters: E-gene CT value.

The application leverages machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM (Linear, RBF, Sigmoid), to provide diagnostic recommendations. It features an interactive Streamlit interface with navigation for screening, risk assessment, and primary treatment guidance.
✨ Features

Interactive UI: Input personal data, select symptoms via checkboxes, and choose from multiple ML models for predictions.
Multi-Model Predictions: Compare results from Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM variants.
Data Visualization: Displays input data in a structured table for clarity.
Navigation: Sidebar with options for Screening Tool, Risk Assessment, and Primary Treatment.
Custom Styling: Colorful, responsive design with HTML/CSS enhancements for a professional look.
